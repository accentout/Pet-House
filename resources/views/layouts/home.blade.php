                        cultural traditions. In communication with an animal, a person can draw powerful social support,
                        but this depends on how strong the attachment between the owner and the pet is.</p>

                    <p class="lead">In the house where a pet appears, everything changes - from the way of life to the
                        schedule of sleep and wakefulness. New things appear in the rooms. But most importantly, both
                        adults and children become happier and more stress-resistant. In order for this state of affairs
                        to persist as long as possible, it is necessary to take care of pets.</p>

                        Perhaps someone else will want to take it for themselves, so leave an ad on our website. We will
                        take your pet and take care of it until it finds a new owner.</p>
